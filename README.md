# Blockchain-Enabled Citizen Feedback System

## Overview

The Blockchain-Enabled Citizen Feedback System is a decentralized application that revolutionizes how citizens interact with government services. By leveraging blockchain technology, this platform creates a transparent, immutable, and efficient channel for citizens to report issues, track resolutions, and provide feedback on government responsiveness. The system ensures accountability in public service delivery while building trust between citizens and government institutions.

- Sentiment analysis integration
- Rating verification to prevent manipulation
- Public rating aggregation dashboards

## Technical Architecture

The system is built on a secure and scalable blockchain infrastructure with the following layers:

1. **Blockchain Layer:** Provides immutable record-keeping and transparent transaction validation
2. **Smart Contract Layer:** Contains the four core contracts that govern system operations
3. **API Layer:** Facilitates integration with existing government systems and third-party services
4. **User Interface Layer:** Web portal and mobile applications for citizen and government official access

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16.0+)
- Truffle Suite or Hardhat
- Web3 wallet (for government officials)
- Basic understanding of blockchain interactions

### Installation
```bash
